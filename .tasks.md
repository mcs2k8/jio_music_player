# TO-DO list

- Add support for local files 
  - scan the phone storage
  - find all the files
  - cache them in a database of some sort


  

# Interesting notes

- When playing all songs shuffled together, there is no playlist option! Do not show the playlist, it might be too big
- Playlists should have a maximum number of songs that can be added
-
