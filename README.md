## What is it?

Jio Music Player is based on the concept of Buddhism. We are on this Earth together, and we should strive to do good deeds for others. I made the code for the player public so that others may use it for their own purposes. Feel free to learn from this code (although I wouldn't describe myself as having the best coding practices), or compile your own Music Player.

## Why use Jio?
The main thing I wanted with Jio was to make a hassle-free music player that can play local music. Once that was done, I wanted to be able to listen to free music. At that time I found out that it's possible to use the QQ, Netease, Kugou and Kuwo APIs to listen to songs for free. Thus, this app was slowly born.

## Work in Progress
Please remember that this app is still largely a work in progress. I am once person working on this in my own spare time. If you like this app, I would appreciate any support you can give.
